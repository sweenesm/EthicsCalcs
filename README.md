Project Description 
=================== 
Python code that calculates the
most ethical (most net value building) decision in a given scenario.

This is a proof-of-concept, "demo\" code that includes only a limited
set of possible value destructions and builds. It can be used for
calculating the most ethical decision in some idealized hypothetical
ethical dilemmas such as the "trolley problem."

Two files are used by this code: ValueDestructionsListShort.txt and
ValueBuildsListShort.txt. They are included in this repot.

The Python version used was 3.9.13.

For more information on these ethics calculations, check back here for a
link to a write up about them. The write up will include links to
minimal sets of value builds and value destructions (beyond what are
used in this Python code), and examples of ethical dilemma calculations
for multiple versions of the "trolley problem.\"
